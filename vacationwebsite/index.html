                <p>Travel agencies have a rich history intertwined with the development of the tourism industry. They began taking shape during the Industrial Revolution, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Cook"><em>Thomas Cook</em></a> being a key figure in organizing package tours. The 20th century saw their expansion alongside <strong>improved transportation.</strong> Computerization and Global Distribution Systems (GDS) revolutionized the industry, followed by the rise of Online Travel Agencies (OTAs) with the advent of the internet. Today, travel agencies offer a wide range of services beyond bookings, such as customized packages and specialized assistance. They continue to evolve by incorporating technology and promoting sustainable tourism practices.</p>
