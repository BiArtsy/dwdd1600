                <dt>Adobe Illustrator</dt>
                    <dd>If your work as a graphic designer centers around vectors and vector images, then Adobe Illustrator is your best friend. Illustrator is part of Adobe's Creative Suite, an all-encompassing collection of tools for video editing, web development, graphic design, and photography.

                    The software allows you to create unique graphics, logos, fonts, and vector illustrations in one place. This means that you'll spend less time switching between various applications trying to cobble together your best work.
                    
                    Also, there are tons of hidden tools within Adobe Illustrator that you can use to create astonishing designs. Of course, vector designs are unaffected by pixelation and other image quality parameters, so you can rest assured that your work will look fantastic, even when it's rescaled or resized.</dd>
                 <dt>Adobe Photoshop</dt>
                        <dd>Adobe Photoshop is the most ubiquitous graphic editing tool for graphics designers today, setting the gold standard for other image editing software globally. It's the first major professional-grade editing tool you'll likely use when creating and editing images and other graphics.

                            If you're a novice graphic designer, some simple techniques to help you learn how to use Photoshop can be incredibly valuable. You can learn how to apply basic editing techniques like background removal, creating custom shapes, and adding unique effects to photos and images.
                            
                            Additionally, it is useful for everything from manipulating 2D and 3D images to performing image analysis and composition. Of course, you can also use it to edit computer-generated imagery and real-life photos.</dd>
